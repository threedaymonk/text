# Levenshtein distance algorithm implementation for Ruby, with UTF-8 support.
#
# The Levenshtein distance is a measure of how similar two strings s and t are,
# calculated as the number of deletions/insertions/substitutions needed to
# transform s into t. The greater the distance, the more the strings differ.
#
# The Levenshtein distance is also sometimes referred to as the
# easier-to-pronounce-and-spell 'edit distance'.

module Levenshtein

  # Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings +str1+ and +str2+.
  # +str1+ and +str2+ should be ASCII, UTF-8, or a one-byte-per character encoding such
  # as ISO-8859-*.
  #
  # The strings will be treated as UTF-8 if $KCODE is set appropriately (i.e. 'u').
  # Otherwise, the comparison will be performed byte-by-byte. There is no specific support
  # for Shift-JIS or EUC strings.
  #
  # When using Unicode text, be aware that this algorithm does not perform normalisation.
  # If there is a possibility of different normalised forms being used, normalisation
  # should be performed beforehand.
